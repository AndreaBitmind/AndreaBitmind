<h1 align="center">👋🏻 Hey there!</h1>
<br>
<p>I'm a Biotechnologist with a background in project management. After several years working in the Health sector, I decided to reinvent myself and transition into the Tech industry.

As a skilled software developer with a solid foundation in programming, I am currently focused on testing and quality assurance development. This shift allows me to leverage my technical skills and coding expertise to ensure the highest standards of software quality and reliability. <br><br>
